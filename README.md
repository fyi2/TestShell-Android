# TestShell-Android
### Simple set of screents and functionality

Basically this has some functionality I am always looking for, **in one place!** It has a home screen with a floating button that takes you to a test screen. The test screen has two tabs. The first has a button that fires off a pop-up. The second tab has a dummy recycler view on it.

To top it off it has a nice background and color scheme.

###Oh! and it's written in Kotlin.
